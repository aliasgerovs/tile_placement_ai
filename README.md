Introduction

The problem statement involves designing a CSP algorithm to solve a tile placement problem on a given landscape with different colored bushes. The problem requires finding a suitable tile placement configuration that satisfies a given target condition of visible bushes. The problem aims to develop an efficient algorithm using heuristics, search algorithms, and constraint propagation to solve the problem.

Problem Definition

The problem involves fitting 3 different shapes of tiles, namely L-shape, outer block, and full block, onto a grid with specific target values for each color. The aim is to find a configuration of tiles that satisfies all the target values while considering the number of tiles used. The problem can be formulated as a CSP, where the variables are the tiles' shapes and locations, the domains are the possible values for each variable, and the constraints are the target values for each color.

Algorithm

The algorithm implemented for solving the problem is a backtracking search algorithm. It traverses the search space and tries to assign each variable a value that satisfies the constraints. The algorithm incorporates several techniques to improve its efficiency, such as Minimum Remaining Value (MRV) heuristic for selecting the next variable to assign, and Forward Checking for pruning the search space by removing values that would violate the constraints. Additionally, it uses Least Constraining Value (LCV) heuristic for selecting the values to assign to a variable that will leave the maximum number of choices for the remaining variables.

Domain

In this implementation of a CSP problem, the domains are the possible values that each variable can take. The variables in this problem are the shapes that can be used to fill the areas in the landscape. The domain for each variable is the set of all possible shapes that can be used to fill a particular area in the landscape.

Constraints

The constraints are the rules that must be followed when selecting a shape for a particular area in the landscape. The constraints in this problem ensure that each tile is correctly positioned on the landscape. A valid position is one where the tile does not overlap with any other tile and remains within the boundaries of the landscape. The another set of constraints are the tile count constraints, which limit the number of times each type of shape can be used. For example, there is a limit on the number of L-shapes, full blocks, and outer boundary blocks that can be used. The second set of constraints are the target constraints, which specify the number of tiles of each color that must be present in the final solution. The goal is to find a combination of shapes that satisfies all of these constraints.
Overall, the CSP problem involves finding an assignment of shapes to the areas in the landscape that satisfies both the tile count constraints and the target constraints.

Functions:

The CSP solver uses the following functions to solve the landscape design problem:
check_target: This function checks if the current state satisfies the target state's requirements.
Full_block: This function returns the count of each block type in a full-block shape.
Outer_block: This function returns the count of each block type in an outer-block shape.
L_shape: This function returns the count of each block type in an L-shape.
apply_function: This function applies a given function to the current Landscape state and returns the result.
